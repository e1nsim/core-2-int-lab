    <div class="intro">Candles can be grouped by size in different grams. Size can affect how long a candle will burn
      and where it can be placed.
      <br>
      Candles can be grouped by brand, such as Jo Malone, Le Labo, or Diptyque. This can be useful for organizing a
      collection based on the popularity or reputation of the brand.
      <br>
      Candles can be grouped by price. Price is an important consideration for many candle shoppers.
      Candles can be grouped by scent, such as floral, fruity, woody, or spicy. This can be useful for organizing a
      collection based on fragrance preference or mood.
      <br>
      Candles can have a significant impact on our mood and emotions. Some candles are designed to create a relaxing
      atmosphere, while others are meant to energize or inspire. Examples of mood-based candle categories include
      "calming and peaceful," "uplifting and invigorating," "romantic and sensual," or "festive and celebratory."
      <br>
      Candles often have a description on their packaging or online listing that describes their scent, purpose, or
      inspiration. Examples of candle descriptions include "uplifting and energizing," "relaxing and soothing," or
      "perfect for a cozy night in." Candles can be grouped based on their descriptions to help shoppers find candles
      that match their preferences.
