        In A Vernacular Web, Olia Liana explains the early internet where people created their own websites and incorporated their own elements. Liana argues that the vernacular web was unique phenomenon that has not been lost, but hidden by the income of professional tools and guidelines. She also reflects on how social media and web 2.0 has changed how we view the web. Although the way these early websites can be seen as outdated, there is a lot to learn especially with the freedom of expression. Olia also presents examples of personal webpages and the way they functioned which allowed me to appreciate the craft put into each site.
In My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?, Laurel Schwulst answers the question of “what is a website?”. Schwulst presents the general meaning of what a website holds but also goes deeper into what kind of place a website has in the world today. She specifically uses metaphors of identifiable words with meanings that allows further understanding of how the website can be a world in itself. The presentation of such ideas were inspiring and promotes creativity to express ourselves in a form of a website. Overall it allowed me to appreciate more of what websites are and can be.
