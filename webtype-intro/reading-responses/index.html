    <h3>A Vernacular Web by Olia Liana</h3>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        In A Vernacular Web, Olia Liana explains the early internet where people created their own websites and incorporated their own elements. Liana argues that the vernacular web was unique phenomenon that has not been lost, but hidden by the income of professional tools and guidelines. She also reflects on how social media and web 2.0 has changed how we view the web. Although the way these early websites can be seen as outdated, there is a lot to learn especially with the freedom of expression. Olia also presents examples of personal webpages and the way they functioned which allowed me to appreciate the craft put into each site.

    <h3>My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge by Laurel Schwulst</h3>
    <p2> In My Website is a Shifting House next to a River of Knowledge. What could yours be?, Laurel Schwulst answers the question of “what is a website?”. Schwulst presents the general meaning of what a website holds but also goes deeper into what kind of place a website has in the world today. She specifically uses metaphors of identifiable words with meanings that allows further understanding of how the website can be a world in itself. The presentation of such ideas were inspiring and promotes creativity to express ourselves in a form of a website. Overall it allowed me to appreciate more of what websites are and can be.</p>

    <h3><span class="title">Typography and the Screen: A Technical Chronology of Digital Typography</span><span class="author"> by Loretta Staples</span></h3>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        In Typography and the Screen: A Technical Chronology of Digital Typography, Loretta Staples explains how the introduction of design through technology changed the norms of typography. Staples describes the enhancements for typing made through the Macintosh Operating System as well as other software. The capabilities that such software were able to produce gives context to the development of the importance of typography from the earliest stages. With technology becoming more and more ingrained into everyday lives, the importance of typography increased and letterforms became more elaborate and detailed. It was compelling to read the problem-solving involved in forming the looks of individual characters because it didn't occur to me that the smallest improvement can create an impactful change. Overall, the reading’s explanation of typographic innovation in cyberspace was insightful and allowed me to learn technology’s influence on the formation of letters we see today.

        <h3><span class="title">The Web's Grain</span><span class="author"> by Frank Chimero</span></h3>
        <time></time>
        <p>
         In Frank Chimero’s site, The Web’s Grain”, Chimero discusses the topic of designing for screens. Chimero speaks in a way that interacts with the audience, establishing a sense of questioning oneself on the design choices they’ve seen or made. Reading Chimero call out basic design choices made in many websites was interesting and it was also enlightening to learn how such designs became an easy way for problem-solving. For instance, the blurred background was a recognizable feature as I have seen it in use for websites and even website building templates. Each pinpoint of basic design choices Chimero speaks of prompted me to think about how one could create a design that breaks free from standard forms of problem solving. The statement “the web is forcing our hands” also stood out to me because it is the cause of why websites take similar formats. Following such statement, Chimero partially answers the question I raised when he asks “what would happen if we stopped treating the web like a blank canvas to paint on, and instead like a material to build with?”. Reading the question he makes reframes the approach to creating websites, especially as designers, as it is easy to have the canvas mindset rather than the building mindset. Furthermore, Chimero introduces the edgeless concept as a powerful method in designing web pages where there is no clear edge to the screen. The concept was eye-opening because it made me realize how my default mode of planning a project would to start out by drawing a box. I was intrigued by the idea of edglessness as the idea of not knowing the size until it the content is fully known breaks the limits of a box and allows more flexibility. Overall, I enjoyed reading Chimero’s thoughts as it reframed my mindset on approaching projects and it inspired me to think outside the box.

    <h3><span class="title">Black Gooey Universe:</span><span class="author"> American Artist</span></h3>
    <time></time>
    <p>
        Black Gooey Universe begins by describing the origins of Silicon Valley and how the success of Silicon Valley can be attributed to the creation of the Stanford Research Institute in 1946. SRI provided a space for engineers to work free of economic pressure and allowed them to embrace innovative ideas without fear of retribution. The reading continues to explain that the introduction of the Apple Lisa, which was the first commercial computer to include a graphical user interface, marked a significant change in computer technology. The negative space of the screen began to appear white, replacing the black command-line interface used on computers prior to that, and the computer's ability to point and click on folders and windows made it more accessible to a wider audience. However, although the use of computer technology has now become widespread, the tech industry is still predominantly white. Technology has become commercialized and developers became increasingly out of touch with the interests of users while the field continues to be dominated by white perspectives.
        The use of technology for maintaining and reinforcing systems of oppression is a common occurrence. In the case of racial slavery and its history, the impact on communities of color, particularly the Black community, is profound. The whiteness that is often associated with technology, both in terms of the people who design and develop it and the products themselves, perpetuates anti-blackness and reinforces white supremacy. It was eye-opening to learn about the presence of anti-blackness in even technology with the transition from a black screen to a white screen in computer interfaces. Not only does it erase the contributions of black individuals to technology, but it also standardizes the notion of whiteness. Furthermore, the significance of addressing such systemic biases and working towards creating more inclusive technology seems more crucial, but there needs to be a willingness to challenge own biases.
