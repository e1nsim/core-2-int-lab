            <h3>A Vernacular Web by Olia Liana</h3>
            <time></time>
            <p>
                In A Vernacular Web, Olia Liana explains the early internet where people created their own websites and
                incorporated their own elements. Liana argues that the vernacular web was unique phenomenon that has not
                been lost, but hidden by the income of professional tools and guidelines. She also reflects on how
                social media and web 2.0 has changed how we view the web. Although the way these early websites can be
                seen as outdated, there is a lot to learn especially with the freedom of expression. Olia also presents
                examples of personal webpages and the way they functioned which allowed me to appreciate the craft put
                into each site.

            <h3>My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge by Laurel Schwulst</h3>
            <p2> In My Website is a Shifting House next to a River of Knowledge. What could yours be?, Laurel Schwulst
                answers the question of “what is a website?”. Schwulst presents the general meaning of what a website
                holds but also goes deeper into what kind of place a website has in the world today. She specifically
                uses metaphors of identifiable words with meanings that allows further understanding of how the website
                can be a world in itself. The presentation of such ideas were inspiring and promotes creativity to
                express ourselves in a form of a website. Overall it allowed me to appreciate more of what websites are
                and can be.</p>

            <h3><span class="title">Typography and the Screen: A Technical Chronology of Digital Typography</span><span
                    class="author"> by Loretta Staples</span></h3>
            <time></time>
            <p>
                In Typography and the Screen: A Technical Chronology of Digital Typography, Loretta Staples explains how
                the introduction of design through technology changed the norms of typography. Staples describes the
                enhancements for typing made through the Macintosh Operating System as well as other software. The
                capabilities that such software were able to produce gives context to the development of the importance
                of typography from the earliest stages. With technology becoming more and more ingrained into everyday
                lives, the importance of typography increased and letterforms became more elaborate and detailed. It was
                compelling to read the problem-solving involved in forming the looks of individual characters because it
                didn't occur to me that the smallest improvement can create an impactful change. Overall, the reading’s
                explanation of typographic innovation in cyberspace was insightful and allowed me to learn technology’s
                influence on the formation of letters we see today.

            <h3><span class="title">The Web's Grain</span><span class="author"> by Frank Chimero</span></h3>
            <time></time>
            <p>
                In Frank Chimero’s site, The Web’s Grain”, Chimero discusses the topic of designing for screens. Chimero
                speaks in a way that interacts with the audience, establishing a sense of questioning oneself on the
                design choices they’ve seen or made. Reading Chimero call out basic design choices made in many websites
                was interesting and it was also enlightening to learn how such designs became an easy way for
                problem-solving. For instance, the blurred background was a recognizable feature as I have seen it in
                use for websites and even website building templates. Each pinpoint of basic design choices Chimero
                speaks of prompted me to think about how one could create a design that breaks free from standard forms
                of problem solving. The statement “the web is forcing our hands” also stood out to me because it is the
                cause of why websites take similar formats. Following such statement, Chimero partially answers the
                question I raised when he asks “what would happen if we stopped treating the web like a blank canvas to
                paint on, and instead like a material to build with?”. Reading the question he makes reframes the
                approach to creating websites, especially as designers, as it is easy to have the canvas mindset rather
                than the building mindset. Furthermore, Chimero introduces the edgeless concept as a powerful method in
                designing web pages where there is no clear edge to the screen. The concept was eye-opening because it
                made me realize how my default mode of planning a project would to start out by drawing a box. I was
                intrigued by the idea of edglessness as the idea of not knowing the size until it the content is fully
                known breaks the limits of a box and allows more flexibility. Overall, I enjoyed reading Chimero’s
                thoughts as it reframed my mindset on approaching projects and it inspired me to think outside the box.

            <h3><span class="title">Black Gooey Universe:</span><span class="author"> American Artist</span></h3>
            <time></time>
            <p>
                Black Gooey Universe begins by describing the origins of Silicon Valley and how the success of Silicon
                Valley can be attributed to the creation of the Stanford Research Institute in 1946. SRI provided a
                space for engineers to work free of economic pressure and allowed them to embrace innovative ideas
                without fear of retribution. The reading continues to explain that the introduction of the Apple Lisa,
                which was the first commercial computer to include a graphical user interface, marked a significant
                change in computer technology. The negative space of the screen began to appear white, replacing the
                black command-line interface used on computers prior to that, and the computer's ability to point and
                click on folders and windows made it more accessible to a wider audience. However, although the use of
                computer technology has now become widespread, the tech industry is still predominantly white.
                Technology has become commercialized and developers became increasingly out of touch with the interests
                of users while the field continues to be dominated by white perspectives.
                The use of technology for maintaining and reinforcing systems of oppression is a common occurrence. In
                the case of racial slavery and its history, the impact on communities of color, particularly the Black
                community, is profound. The whiteness that is often associated with technology, both in terms of the
                people who design and develop it and the products themselves, perpetuates anti-blackness and reinforces
                white supremacy. It was eye-opening to learn about the presence of anti-blackness in even technology
                with the transition from a black screen to a white screen in computer interfaces. Not only does it erase
                the contributions of black individuals to technology, but it also standardizes the notion of whiteness.
                Furthermore, the significance of addressing such systemic biases and working towards creating more
                inclusive technology seems more crucial, but there needs to be a willingness to challenge own biases.

            <h3><span class="title">Function as Narrative</span><span class="author"> by Weiyi Li</span></h3>
            <time></time>
            <p>
                In Function as Narrative, Weiyi Li explains her work and how it explores man-made products that can
                indicate potential changes and tell stories through their function.
                In one of her works, Li created a container for medicine called "Help yourself," which is designed to
                hold cold remedy capsules and make the process of taking pills more ritualistic. The container has
                sections for different colored pills and a tiny steel spoon for encapsulating the drugs. However, after
                the Li finished the piece, the Chinese government banned the sale of the flu remedy "ContacNT" because
                it was being used to produce methamphetamine, adding a new layer to the narrative of the piece. Li’s
                work with containers explores how objects can narrate by quoting other objects and how the context of
                the world can impact the meaning of an object.
                Li continues by arguing that while "form follows function" may not be as relevant in modern times, the
                relationship between form and function is still important. They give examples of how specific forms of
                man-made products have become a learned symbol system, and how certain forms can communicate specific
                functions. She also points out that "form follows function" is a one-sided concept from the designer's
                perspective, and that users can accept, reject, or develop the function. Overall, Li’s perspective is
                that the value and meaning of these objects lie in their use and context, rather than their status as
                art.

            <h3><span class="title">Can the Internet Be Archived?</span><span class="author"> by Jill Lepore</span></h3>
            <time></time>
            <p>
                In Jill Lepore’s article “Can the Internet Be Archived?” Lepore argues that the vastness of the internet
                makes it complicated to preserve for the future. With the internet constantly evolving with new
                information and websites replacing old ones as well as copyright laws not keeping up with technological
                change, it makes it challenging to create an archive that reflects the internet as a whole at any period
                of time. Additionally, Lepore highlights that the internet has changed the way people interact and
                digital archiving should reflect such changes. Preserving digital archives is essential for preserving
                culture and understanding history. The Internet Archive and the Library of Congress’s Web archives are
                examples of attempts to consolidate digital archives for future accessibility.
                The task of preserving digital archives may seem inefficient due to the appeal of new information and
                ideas, but doing so is essential due to the immeasurable amount of information that can be provided in
                every website. Having access to such information allows more detailed information and perspectives of
                history to be present, especially since in the past, those in power would have control over narratives.
                It also can be a source of inspiration as the scale and complexity of the archive provides for diversity
                in ideas.

            <h3><span class="title">Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach</span><span class="author"> by Catherine
                    D'Ignazio</span></h3>
            <time></time>
            <p>
                In “Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach", Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein applies feminist
                principles to data science and technology. The framework is organized around four key principles that
                are essential for creating more inclusive and equitable data practices. It was interesting to read how
                gender inequality and racism can be rooted in simple data collection questions, producing biased data.
                In contrast, data analysis should be utilized to challenge power and promote justice. It was compelling
                to read about how “proof” can assist harmful narratives of certain groups, reducing these groups to
                their problems. Especially since I have seen examples of people stereotyping certain races, insisting
                the accuracy of their point as there is data to back it up. It seems as if data to prove such harmful
                narratives are deliberately collected to further back up problematic points. To combat, it is necessary
                to collect counterdata to prove oppression and spread awareness of of how subjects of oppression is
                displayed. With people in power being able to control narratives, data that may seem objective is, in
                reality, wrong as it is in control of elite white men. To create more just and equitable data practices,
                we must learn from and design with the communities we seek to support, acknowledging the reality of
                ongoing oppression and committing to dismantling it. This commitment must be taught to the next
                generation of data practitioners if we want to move towards a more just future.

            <p>
                In “Sharing as Survival: Mindy Seu on the Cyberfeminism Index”, Seu reflects on the importance of
                diversity and inclusivity in the field of technology, noting that the legacy of cyberfeminism can help
                us understand and address issues of power and privilege in our digital world. She emphasizes the need to
                center marginalized voices and perspectives, and to recognize the ways in which technology can both
                perpetuate and challenge systems of oppression. Seu notes that the creators of the internet have control
                over the narratives put out, limiting perspectives and making it challenging for original cyberfeminist
                sites to be found. Through Seu’s Index, the legacy of cyberfeminism is highlighted and continued with
                the continuous call to add submissions.

                xox. Skawennati's art highlights the potential of combining traditional storytelling with digital media
                to pre-record a future history, and she believes that sci-fi tropes provide a means to imagine a better
                future for Indigenous people and society at large. Her use of technology draws on ancient traditions to
                create a futuristic vision.
