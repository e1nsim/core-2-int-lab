        <h2>Response to: CD Lecture: Elaine Lopez</h2>
        In the CD Lecture Series, Elaine Lopez shares her practice in creating designs centered around cultural diversity and inequality. She introduces the phrase ‘let’s colonize design’ which I found striking because the phrase seemed counterintuitive when first heard, but Lopez’s in-depth reasoning of the term allowed me to understand its meaning. Lopez explains that the word ‘decolonization’ is applied in a way that the meaning is diffused, undermining the people who have been displaced and are fighting for sovereignty. She continues to explain that graphic design can be used as a tool of colonization and raises the question of what parts of design should be removed without turning away people of color. It’s a heavy question as a bulk of the elements of design we standardize today are coined from the West. In the phrase ‘let’s colonize design’  Lopez suggests that we add our own cultures to design and build upon the current standards to diversify it. Overall, it was a new perspective to twist the meaning of decolonization and suggest change in design to make it more inclusive.
