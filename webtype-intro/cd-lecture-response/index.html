            <h2>Response to: CD Lecture: <br>Elaine Lopez</h2>
            In the CD Lecture Series, Elaine Lopez shares her practice in creating designs centered around cultural
            diversity and inequality. She introduces the phrase ‘let’s colonize design’ which I found striking because
            the phrase seemed counterintuitive when first heard, but Lopez’s in-depth reasoning of the term allowed me
            to understand its meaning. Lopez explains that the word ‘decolonization’ is applied in a way that the
            meaning is diffused, undermining the people who have been displaced and are fighting for sovereignty. She
            continues to explain that graphic design can be used as a tool of colonization and raises the question of
            what parts of design should be removed without turning away people of color. It’s a heavy question as a bulk
            of the elements of design we standardize today are coined from the West. In the phrase ‘let’s colonize
            design’ Lopez suggests that we add our own cultures to design and build upon the current standards to
            diversify it. Overall, it was a new perspective to twist the meaning of decolonization and suggest change in
            design to make it more inclusive.

            <h2>Response to: CD Lecture: <br>Pascal Glissman</h2>In his lecture, Pascal Glissman talks about design as a mode of inquiry. In his works,
            Glissman uses observational practices to combine nature and technology. Exploring a variety of urban
            environments and their everyday objects sparked Glissman’s research interests that extend beyond cultural
            and disciplinary boundaries. Glissman explains what it means to observe and translate your observations into
            visual work. When people look at the same thing, they are not actually seeing the same thing and the
            contrast of observations from different people can offer meaningful discussions to learn from one another.
            Overall, from the lecture I gained insight on being more open-minded when it comes to design as people will
            always have different interpretations of what they’re observing. It was insightful to hear how different
            events can play a large impact on how we view certain things. </div>
