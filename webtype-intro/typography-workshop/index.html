            Hamsters are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae, which contains 19 species
            classified in seven genera.<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> They have become established as popular small pets.
            <sup>3</sup> The best-known
            species of hamster is the golden or Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), which is the type most commonly
            kept as pets. Other hamster species commonly kept as pets are the three species of dwarf hamster, Campbell's
            dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli), the winter white dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and the Roborovski
            hamster (Phodopus roborovskii).
        </p>
        <p>
            Hamsters are more crepuscular than nocturnal and, in the wild, remain underground during the day to avoid
            being caught by predators. They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat
            burrowing insects.<sup>4</sup> Physically, they are stout-bodied with distinguishing features that include
            elongated
            cheek pouches extending to their shoulders, which they use to carry food back to their burrows, as well as a
            short tail and fur-covered feet.
        </p>

        <h2>CLASSIFICATION</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Taxonomists generally disagree about the most appropriate placement of the subfamily Cricetinae within the
            superfamily Muroidea. Some place it in a family Cricetidae that also includes voles, lemmings, and New World
            rats and mice; others group all these into a large family called Muridae. Their evolutionary history is
            recorded by 15 extinct fossil genera and extends back 11.2 million to 16.4 million years to the Middle
            Miocene Epoch in Europe and North Africa; in Asia it extends 6 million to 11 million years. Four of the
            seven living genera include extinct species. One extinct hamster of Cricetus, for example, lived in North
            Africa during the Middle Miocene, but the only extant member of that genus is the European or common hamster
            of Eurasia.

        <h3>Relationships among hamster species</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Neumann et al. (2006) conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 12 of the above 17 species using DNA
            sequence from three genes: 12S rRNA, cytochrome b, and von Willebrand factor. They uncovered the following
            relationships:[5]</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Phodopus group</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            The genus Phodopus was found to represent the earliest split among hamsters. Their analysis included both
            species. The results of another study[6] suggest Cricetulus kamensis (and presumably the related C.
            alticola) might belong to either this Phodopus group or hold a similar basal position.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Mesocricetus group</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            The genus Mesocricetus also forms a clade. Their analysis included all four species, with M. auratus and M.
            raddei forming one subclade and M. brandti and M. newtoni another.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Remaining genera</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The remaining genera of hamsters formed a third major clade. Two of the three sampled species within
            Cricetulus represent the earliest split. This clade contains C. barabensis (and presumably the related C.
            sokolovi) and C. longicaudatus.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The remaining clade contains members of Allocricetulus, Tscherskia, Cricetus, and C. migratorius.
            Allocricetulus and Cricetus were sister taxa. Cricetulus migratorius was their next closest relative, and
            Tscherskia was basal.

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Although the Syrian hamster or golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) was first described scientifically by
            George Robert Waterhouse in 1839, researchers were not able to successfully breed and domesticate hamsters
            until 1939.[3] The entire laboratory and pet populations of Syrian hamsters appear to be descendants of a
            single brother–sister pairing. These littermates were captured and imported in 1930 from Aleppo in Syria by
            Israel Aharoni, a zoologist of the University of Jerusalem.[7] In Jerusalem, the hamsters bred very
            successfully. Years later, animals of this original breeding colony were exported to the United States,
            where Syrian hamsters became a common pet and laboratory animal. Comparative studies of domestic and wild
            Syrian hamsters have shown reduced genetic variability in the domestic strain. However, the differences in
            behavioral, chronobiological, morphometrical, hematological, and biochemical parameters are relatively small
            and fall into the expected range of interstrain variations in other laboratory animals.[8]

        <h2>ETYMOLOGY</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The name "hamster" is a loanword from the German, which itself derives from earlier Middle High German
            hamastra. It is possibly related to Old Church Slavonic khomestoru, which is either a blend of the root of
            Russian хомяк (khomyak) "hamster" and a Baltic word (cf. Lithuanian staras "hamster");[9] or of Persian
            origin (cf. Av hamaēstar "oppressor").[10] The collective noun for a group of hamsters is "horde".[11] In
            German, the verb "hamstern" is derived from "Hamster". It means "Hoarding".[12]
        </p>
        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hamsters are typically stout-bodied, with tails shorter than body length, and have small, furry ears, short,
            stocky legs, and wide feet. They have thick, silky fur, which can be long or short, colored black, grey,
            honey, white, brown, yellow, red, or a mix, depending on the species. Two species of hamster belonging to
            the genus Phodopus, Campbell's dwarf hamster (P. campbelli) and the Djungarian hamster (P. sungorus), and
            two of the genus Cricetulus, the Chinese striped hamster (C. barabensis) and the Chinese hamster (C.
            griseus) have a dark stripe down their heads to their tails. The species of genus Phodopus are the smallest,
            with bodies 5.5 to 10.5 centimetres (2+1⁄4 to 4+1⁄4 in) long; the largest is the European hamster (Cricetus
            cricetus), measuring up to 34 cm (13+1⁄2 in) long, not including a short tail of up to 6 cm (2+1⁄2 in).
            <br>
            <br>
            The hamster tail can be difficult to see, as it is usually not very long (about 1⁄6 the length of the body),
            with the exception of the Chinese hamster, which has a tail the same length as the body. One rodent
            characteristic that can be highly visible in hamsters is their sharp incisors; they have an upper pair and
            lower pair which grow continuously throughout life, so must be regularly worn down. Hamsters are very
            flexible, however their bones are somewhat fragile. They are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature
            changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Senses</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hamsters have poor eyesight; they are nearsighted and colorblind.[13][14] Their eyesight leads to them not
            having a good sense of distance or knowing where they are, but that doesn't stop them from climbing in (and
            sometimes out of) their cages or from being adventurous. Hamsters can sense movement around at all times,
            which helps protect them from harm in the wild. In a household, this sense helps them know when their owner
            is near.[15] Hamsters have scent glands on their flanks (and abdomens in Chinese and dwarf hamsters) which
            they rub against the surface beneath them, leaving a scent trail.[16] Hamsters also use their sense of smell
            to distinguish between the sexes and to locate food. Mother hamsters can also use their sense of smell to
            find their own babies and identify which ones aren't theirs. Their scent glands can also be used to mark
            their territories, their babies, or their mate.[17] Hamsters catch sounds by having their ears upright. They
            tend to learn similar noises and begin to know the sound of their food and even their owner's voice.[15]
            They are also particularly sensitive to high-pitched noises and can hear and communicate in the ultrasonic
            range.[7]
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hamsters are omnivores, which means they can eat meat and vegetables. Hamsters that live in the wild eat
            seeds, grass, and even insects.[15] Although pet hamsters can survive on a diet of exclusively commercial
            hamster food, other items, such as vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts, can be given. Although store-bought
            food is good for hamsters, it is best if fruits and vegetables are also in their diet because it keeps them
            healthier.[18] Even though hamsters are allowed to have both fruits and vegetables, it is important to
            understand exactly which ones they can have and how much. Hamsters do best with fruits that don't have
            citrus in them and most green leafy vegetables. Hamsters should never be fed junk food, chocolate, garlic,
            or any salty/sugary foods. Hamsters tend to love peanut butter but it is important to feed it to them
            carefully because this sticky food can get stuck in their cheeks.[19] Hamsters in the Middle East have been
            known to hunt in packs to find insects for food.[20] Hamsters are hindgut fermenters and often eat their own
            feces (coprophagy) to recover nutrients digested in the hind-gut, but not absorbed.[2]
        </p>
        <h2>BEHAVIOR</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Feeding</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            A behavioral characteristic of hamsters is food hoarding. They carry food in their spacious cheek pouches to
            their underground storage chambers. When full, the cheeks can make their heads double, or even triple in
            size.[2] Hamsters lose weight during the autumn months in anticipation of winter. This occurs even when
            hamsters are kept as pets and is related to an increase in exercise.[21]
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Social Behavior</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Most hamsters are strictly solitary. If housed together, acute and chronic stress may occur,[8] and they may
            fight fiercely, sometimes fatally. Dwarf hamster species may tolerate siblings or same-gender unrelated
            hamsters if introduced at an early enough age, but this cannot be guaranteed. Hamsters communicate through
            body language to one another and even to their owner. They communicate by sending a specific scent using
            their scent glands and also show body language to express how they are feeling.[17] </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Chronobiology</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hamsters can be described as nocturnal or crepuscular (active mostly at dawn and dusk). Khunen writes,
            "Hamsters are nocturnal rodents who are active during the night...",[8] but others have written that because
            hamsters live underground during most of the day, only leaving their burrows for about an hour before
            sundown and then returning when it gets dark, their behavior is primarily crepuscular. Fritzsche indicated
            although some species have been observed to show more nocturnal activity than others, they are all primarily
            crepuscular.[7]

            In the wild Syrian hamsters can hibernate and allow their body temperature to fall close to ambient
            temperature. This kind of thermoregulation diminishes the metabolic rate to about 5% and helps the animal to
            considerably reduce the need for food during the winter.[8] Hibernation can last up to one week but more
            commonly last 2–3 days.[22] When kept as house pets the Syrian hamster does not hibernate.[22]
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Burrowing Behavior</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            All hamsters are excellent diggers, constructing burrows with one or more entrances, with galleries
            connected to chambers for nesting, food storage, and other activities.[2] They use their fore- and hindlegs,
            as well as their snouts and teeth, for digging. In the wild, the burrow buffers extreme ambient
            temperatures, offers relatively stable climatic conditions, and protects against predators. Syrian hamsters
            dig their burrows generally at a depth of 0.7 m.[23] A burrow includes a steep entrance pipe (4–5 cm in
            diameter), a nesting and a hoarding chamber and a blind-ending branch for urination. Laboratory hamsters
            have not lost their ability to dig burrows; in fact, they will do this with great vigor and skill if they
            are provided with the appropriate substrate.[8]

            Wild hamsters will also appropriate tunnels made by other mammals; the Djungarian hamster, for instance,
            uses paths and burrows of the pika.[24]
        </p>
        <h2>REPRODUCTION</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Fertility</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hamsters become fertile at different ages depending on their species. Both Syrian and Russian hamsters
            mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (4–5 weeks), whereas Chinese hamsters will usually
            begin reproducing at two to three months of age, and Roborovskis at three to four months of age. The
            female's reproductive life lasts about 18 months, but male hamsters remain fertile much longer. Females are
            in estrus about every four days, which is indicated by a reddening of genital areas, a musky smell, and a
            hissing, squeaking vocalisation she will emit if she believes a male is nearby.[3]
            <br>
            <br>
            When seen from above, a sexually mature female hamster has a trim tail line; a male's tail line bulges on
            both sides. This might not be very visible in all species. Male hamsters typically have very large testes in
            relation to their body size. Before sexual maturity occurs, it is more difficult to determine a young
            hamster's sex. When examined, female hamsters have their anal and genital openings close together, whereas
            males have these two holes farther apart (the penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a
            hole or pink pimple).[3]
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Gestation and fecundity</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Syrian hamsters are seasonal breeders and will produce several litters a year with several pups in each
            litter. The breeding season is from April to October in the Northern Hemisphere, with two to five litters of
            one to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days.[20] Dwarf hamsters breed all through
            the year. Gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian hamsters, 18 to 21 days for Russian hamsters, 21 to 23
            days for Chinese hamsters and 23 to 30 for Roborovski hamsters. The average litter size for Syrian hamsters
            is about seven pups, but can be as great as 24, which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in
            the uterus. Campbell's dwarf hamsters tend to have four to eight pups in a litter, but can have up to 13.
            Winter white hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski hamsters.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Intersexual aggression and cannibalism</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Female Chinese and Syrian hamsters are known for being aggressive toward males if kept together for too long
            after mating. In some cases, male hamsters can die after being attacked by a female. If breeding hamsters,
            separation of the pair after mating is recommended, or they will attack each other.

            Female hamsters are also particularly sensitive to disturbances while giving birth, and may even eat their
            own young if they think they are in danger, although sometimes they are just carrying the pups in their
            cheek pouches.[7] If captive female hamsters are left for extended periods (three weeks or more) with their
            litter, they may cannibalize the litter, so the litter must be removed by the time the young can feed and
            drink independently.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Weaning</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hamsters are born hairless and blind in a nest the mother will have prepared in advance.[3] After one week,
            they begin to explore outside the nest. Hamsters are capable of producing litters every month. Hamsters can
            be bred after they are three weeks old. It may be hard for the babies to not rely on their mother for
            nursing during this time, so it is important that they are supplied with food to make the transition from
            nursing to eating on their own easier. After the hamsters reach three weeks of age they are considered
            mature.[25]
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Longevity</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Syrian hamsters typically live no more than two to three years in captivity, and less in the wild. Russian
            hamsters (Campbell's and Djungarian) live about two to four years in captivity, and Chinese hamsters 2+1⁄2–3
            years. The smaller Roborovski hamster often lives to three years in captivity.[2]

            The best-known species of hamster is the golden or Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), which is the type
            most commonly kept as pets. There are numerous Syrian hamster variations including long-haired varieties and
            different colors. British zoologist Leonard Goodwin claimed most hamsters kept in the United Kingdom were
            descended from the colony he introduced for medical research purposes during the Second World War.[26]
            Hamsters were domesticated and kept as pets in the United States at least as early as 1942.[27]

            A spacious hamster cage made from a display cabinet
            Other hamsters commonly kept as pets are the three species of dwarf hamster. Campbell's dwarf hamster
            (Phodopus campbelli) is the most common—they are also sometimes called "Russian dwarfs"; however, many
            hamsters are from Russia, so this ambiguous name does not distinguish them from other species appropriately.
            The coat of the winter white dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus) turns almost white during winter (when the
            hours of daylight decrease).[3] The Roborovski hamster (Phodopus roborovskii) is extremely small and fast,
            making it difficult to keep as a pet.[2]

        <h3>Hamster shows</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            A hamster show is an event in which people gather hamsters to judge them against each other.[28] Hamster
            shows are also places where people share their enthusiasm for hamsters among attendees. Hamster shows
            feature an exhibition of the hamsters participating in the judging.[28]
            <br>
            <br>
            The judging of hamsters usually includes a goal of promoting hamsters which conform to natural or
            established varieties of hamsters.[28] By awarding hamsters which match standard hamster types, hamster
            shows encourage planned and careful hamster breeding.[28]

        <h3>Owner activism</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            When the first reported case of animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong took place via
            imported pet hamsters, researchers expressed difficulty in identifying some of the viral mutations within a
            global genomic data bank, leading city authorities to announce a mass cull of all hamsters purchased after
            December 22, 2021, which would affect roughly 2,000 animals. After the government 'strongly encouraged'
            citizens to turn in their pets, approximately 3,000 people joined underground activities to promote the
            adoption of abandoned hamsters throughout the city and to maintain pet ownership via methods such as the
            forgery of pet store purchase receipts. Some activists attempted to intercept owners who were on their way
            to turn in pet hamsters and encourage them to choose adoption instead, which the government subsequently
            warned would be subject to police action.[29][30]

        <br>
        <p>Some similar rodents sometimes called "hamsters" are not currently classified in the hamster subfamily
            Cricetinae. These include the maned hamster, or crested hamster, which is really the maned rat (Lophiomys
            imhausi). Others are the mouse-like hamsters (Calomyscus spp.), and the white-tailed rat (Mystromys
            albicaudatus).</p>
